# Spot

## What Spot is

Spot is a CLI-first NYC restaurant reservation service. It hunts the big booking platforms — Resy, OpenTable, SevenRooms, and DoorDash — on the user's behalf. The model has two tracks:

1. **Book-now.** If a desirable slot exists this moment, book it.
2. **Autobook search.** If nothing is available, create a *search* targeting up to 5 restaurants over a date/time window; the server grabs the first matching slot as soon as one drops.

Both tracks are first-class. Know which one fits the user's situation before reaching for a command.

## Core concepts

- **Restaurant** — a venue in the Spot catalog. Discover with `spot restaurants search <query>`; get detail with `spot restaurants get <id>`.
- **Reservation** — a booked table the user holds. Upcoming via `spot reservations list`; full log (past + upcoming + external platforms) via `spot reservations history`.
- **Search** — the user's standing autobook request. Has a date/time window, party size, and **up to 5 restaurant targets**. The first target that drops a matching slot gets booked.
- **SearchTarget** — one restaurant attached to a search.
- **Slot** — an immediate-booking opportunity returned by `spot reservations search`. Each slot has a **~5-minute TTL** on the server. If the user hesitates, re-run search.
- **Platform connection** — booking requires the user to have linked their Resy / OpenTable / SevenRooms / DoorDash account via the Spot **mobile app**. Cannot be linked from the CLI. If a book call returns `ErrPlatformNotConnected` (exit 10), stop and tell the user to open the mobile app.
- **Time zone** — every date and time in the CLI is `America/New_York`. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`; times are `HH:MM` or `HH:MM:SS`.

## Opening routine

On the first relevant query in a session, run these three commands **in parallel** with `--json` and cache the results for the rest of the session:

```
spot auth whoami --json
spot reservations list --json
spot searches list --json
```

Use the snapshot to inform every suggestion:

- Don't propose booking a slot the user already holds.
- Don't create a new search if an existing one already covers the intent — offer to update it instead.
- If `auth whoami` fails, tell the user to run `spot auth login` and wait.
- Check `connectedPlatforms` on the whoami result — if the platform needed for a booking isn't connected, warn early instead of letting `book` fail.

### When the intent is discovery, also load history

If the user is picking a restaurant (planning a dinner, monitoring for a drop, looking for a replacement), also run:

```
spot reservations history --json
```

Skip this for state-only queries ("what do I have?") and for specific-restaurant bookings where the user already named the place. The next section explains how to mine it.

## Using history as soft preference signal

Reservation history is the cheapest personalization signal available — the user's past bookings tell you what they're into before they say a word. Mine it to cold-start recommendations.

**What to extract from the history response:**

- **Cuisine affinity** — frequency of each `table.restaurant.cuisine` across past bookings.
- **Neighborhood patterns** — frequency of `table.restaurant.neighborhood`. Weight recent bookings more heavily than older ones.
- **Typical party size** — mode of `table.party`. Useful as a default when the user says "dinner" without specifying.
- **Time tendency** — are they early (pre-7pm) or late (post-9pm)? Derived from `table.time`.
- **Seating preference** — bar vs dining room, from `table.seating`.
- **Booking style** — average `table.restaurant.bookingDifficulty`. High → they chase tough reservations; low → casual choices. Calibrates how ambitious your recs should be.
- **Recently visited** — restaurant IDs in the last ~30 days. These should rank lower in new recommendations (variety bias).

**How to use it:**

- **Treat as a prior, not a constraint.** If history is Italian-heavy, that's a starting guess, not a filter. Never silently exclude non-Italian restaurants from recommendations.
- **Explicitly invite deviation.** When patterns are clear, lead with them and offer an escape hatch: *"You usually go for Italian downtown — want that, or break pattern tonight?"*
- **Seed defaults from patterns.** Party always 2? Default the party flag to 2 when the user doesn't specify. Always 7:30? Default the time window to 6:30–9:00.
- **Avoid recent re-recommendations.** When ranking candidates from `restaurants search`, deprioritize anything the user visited in the last ~30 days. Mention by name if you're intentionally skipping a frequent favorite so the user can override.
- **Stated preferences beat inferred ones, every time.** "Japanese tonight" beats an Italian-heavy history. Drop the prior and go.

**Cold-start behavior:**

- **Thin history (<3 entries):** don't infer. Ask the user directly as you would for a new user.
- **Rich history (20+ entries):** on the first discovery turn, consider opening with a short pattern recap: *"Looks like you're a Flatiron regular who leans Italian. Want to stay in that lane, or stretch?"* Sets tone, gives the user an easy way to redirect.
- Somewhere in between: use the signal but don't call it out.

## Decision tree

### Intent: "book <specific restaurant> on <date> at <time> for <N>"

1. Resolve the restaurant ID via `spot restaurants search <name>` if not already in cache.
2. `spot reservations search --restaurant <id> --date <YYYY-MM-DD> --start-time HH:MM --end-time HH:MM --party <N> --json`.
3. If slots exist: pick the closest match to the stated time. Narrate it in plain language and ask confirmation: *"About to book Gramercy Tavern on May 15 at 7:00 PM for 2 people on Resy. Proceed?"*. On confirmation, `spot reservations book <slotId>`.
4. If no slots: offer to create an autobook search. Suggest adding similar-vibe fallback restaurants (up to 5 total) so the user has a real chance of a match. Use `spot searches create --restaurant a,b,c --date ... --start-time ... --end-time ... --party ...`.

### Intent: "plan <something> in <neighborhood> on <date>" (research mode)

1. `spot restaurants search <query>` for candidates — query by neighborhood, cuisine, or vibe word.
2. Narrow to 3–5 top candidates. Optionally `spot restaurants get <id>` on each to read cuisine, party limits, hours, and active platforms.
3. `spot reservations search --restaurant a,b,c --date ... --start-time ... --end-time ... --party <N>` across candidates in one call.
4. Present ranked options: time fit, seating, platform, any other differentiators. Let the user pick.
5. Confirm + book the chosen slot, same as the book flow.

### Intent: "what do I have?"

Replay the opening-routine snapshot. Summarize upcoming reservations, active searches, and connected platforms in plain language. No commands needed beyond the snapshot.

### Platform-not-connected error (exit code 10)

Stop the booking flow. Tell the user explicitly which platform needs linking ("your Resy account isn't linked to Spot — open the Spot mobile app to connect it"). **Do not silently try other platforms.** The user may prefer that specific restaurant.

### Slot-expired error (exit code 11)

Recoverable. Re-run `spot reservations search` with the original params, pick the closest match to the original intent, confirm with the user, and try `book` again. If it expires twice, surface the issue — likely a very hot room.

## Autonomy rules

Different actions warrant different levels of ceremony.

**Confirm in plain language before:**
- `spot reservations book` — holds a real table.
- `spot reservations cancel` — releases a real table and may incur cancellation fees.
- `spot searches delete` — removes the autobook hunt.

Canonical phrasing: *"About to <verb> <entity> at <restaurant> on <date> at <time> for <party>. Proceed?"*

**Auto with a brief announcement (reversible, low-cost failure):**
- `spot searches create`
- `spot searches update`

Example: *"Setting up a search for Don Angie, Via Carota, and L'Artusi on May 15, 6–8 PM, party of 2."* Then run.

**Silent (no ceremony needed — read-only):**
- `spot auth whoami`
- `spot reservations list`, `history`, `search`
- `spot restaurants search`, `get`
- `spot searches list`, `get`

Never proactively run `spot auth logout` or `spot auth logout --all`. Those are user-initiated only.

## Errors and exit codes

The CLI uses stable exit codes. The most common ones:

| Code | Sentinel | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | — | Success | — |
| 3 | `ErrUnauthenticated` | Not logged in / session expired | Tell user to run `spot auth login` |
| 5 | `ErrRestaurantNotFound`, `ErrSearchNotFound`, `ErrReservationNotFound` | Entity not found | Name the specific missing entity |
| 7 | `ErrValidation` | Bad request | Show the server's message verbatim |
| 10 | `ErrPlatformNotConnected` | Booking platform not linked | Direct user to mobile app for that platform |
| 11 | `ErrSlotExpired` | Slot TTL expired or snapped up | Re-search transparently; retry once |

For any non-zero exit not listed: show the server's message. Don't fabricate explanations.

## Format conventions

- **Dates:** `YYYY-MM-DD`. Always resolve relative phrases ("this Friday", "next weekend") to an absolute date and **confirm with the user** before running commands.
- **Times:** `HH:MM` (CLI normalizes) or `HH:MM:SS`. All America/New_York.
- **Party size:** positive integer.
- **Restaurant flag:** `--restaurant` accepts a comma-separated list or can be repeated. Max 5 per search.
- **`--json` is authoritative.** Table mode is pretty for humans; use `--json` when parsing output.

## Recipes

Pattern library for common flows. Read the recipe that matches the user's intent before acting:

- `recipes/find-and-book.md` — book a specific restaurant / date, or fall back to an autobook search.
- `recipes/plan-dinner.md` — research + narrow + book across neighborhoods.
- `recipes/monitor-drop.md` — no availability? Set a search and explain autobook.
- `recipes/check-state.md` — snapshot of upcoming + searches + connected platforms.
- `recipes/cancel-and-rebook.md` — change plans cleanly.
